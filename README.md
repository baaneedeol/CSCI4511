# Artificial Intelligence — Coursework & Projects

This repository documents my work and learning from an upper-level Artificial Intelligence course, where I developed both a strong technical foundation in classical AI and a critical perspective on the ethical and societal implications of intelligent systems.

## What I Learned

Through this course, I learned how to formulate real-world problems as state-space search problems, design rational agents, and evaluate AI systems using meaningful performance measures. I gained hands-on experience with core AI algorithms and learned how design choices affect optimality, efficiency, and scalability.

Key concepts I worked with include:

Intelligent agents and rational decision-making

State-space representations and problem abstraction

Uninformed and informed search (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, Adaptive A*)

Heuristic design and admissibility

Knowledge representation using predicate logic and resolution

Planning and constraint satisfaction

Foundations of neural networks

Ethical challenges in AI systems

## Writing & Critical Analysis

A major part of this course emphasized clear technical writing and critical thinking:

Ethics of AI Reflection
I analyzed ethical case studies from Ben Kuipers’ Perspectives on Ethics of AI, focusing on how social norms, trust, and accountability shape the deployment of AI systems. This helped me better understand why technical correctness alone is insufficient when AI systems interact with society.

Adaptive A* Paper Review
I wrote a technical review of Adaptive A* by Koenig and Likhachev, summarizing the algorithm’s motivation, explaining how heuristics are updated during search, reproducing experimental results, and evaluating the clarity and effectiveness of the paper.

Research-Driven Project Proposal & Literature Review (Collaborative)
For our final project, I worked closely with a teammate to develop and compare heuristic-based path-planning algorithms (A and D-Lite)** for robot navigation in 2D indoor environments. Together, we synthesized prior work, implemented and tested algorithms in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib, and evaluated them on metrics like path optimality, computation time, and adaptability to dynamic obstacles. Collaboration allowed us to divide tasks effectively while maintaining a cohesive approach to experimentation and analysis.

## Programming & Implementation

I implemented and experimented with AI algorithms using the AIMA Python codebase, primarily in Google Colab. My work included:

Solving navigation problems using BFS, DFS, UCS, and A*

Modifying search algorithms to analyze memory–optimality trade-offs

Running and comparing different vacuum world agents

Measuring path cost, performance, and computational efficiency

Experimenting with heuristic-based replanning in dynamic environments

Through both individual assignments and our collaborative final project, I strengthened my ability to bridge theory and implementation, debug search behavior, and evaluate algorithmic performance in realistic scenarios.

## Takeaways

This course deepened my understanding of how classical AI methods remain foundational to modern intelligent systems. More importantly, it taught me to think critically about why an algorithm works, when it should be used, and how its design choices impact real-world outcomes—both technically and ethically. Working collaboratively on the final project also improved my ability to coordinate, communicate, and integrate ideas effectively in a team setting.
